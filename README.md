## **Documentation**

**Note:** I am not the maintainer of the GSI itself. I am an **unofficial maintainer** of the device port. I will continue to update this fork, including any AIO modules for optimization if needed.

A big thanks to everyone tagged below for their contributions!

## **Features**

- **Optimized** specifically for the Samsung A03 Core.
- **Removed unnecessary Treble overlays** that don’t provide benefits for the Samsung A03 Core.
- Added **full** Google Apps (almost all):
    ```
    • Play Store
    • Google App (Velvet)
    • Chrome
    • Photos
    • And all necessary services for stable Google services functionality
    ```
- Hidden Treble settings for a cleaner **full-ROM feel**.  
  To access them, use the following command in a superuser terminal (these will hide again after reboot):
    ```
    su -c "pm enable me.phh.treble.app/.TopLevelSettingsActivity"
    ```
- Offline charging now redirects to system reboot.
- **Lawnchair 14** launcher fork, for a cleaner, modern UI.

- **I love xdroid!**

## **Differences from Default xdroid** *(Not My Changelog)*

- Replaced arm64 apps with arm32. *(Note: The app change list is missing, as the GSI was released two years ago)*
- **Modded Pixel Launcher** *(Removed after U V1-HotFix)*  
  - [Source](https://github.com/Ardjlon/vendor_PixelLauncher)

---

## **Bugs**

- **No VoLTE support.**
- No offline charging (now a feature due to redirection to system reboot instead of being stuck at the Samsung logo).
- **Please replace the wallpaper** to **avoid lag**.
