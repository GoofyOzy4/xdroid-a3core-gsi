## **‚≠ê ‚Ä¢ Features**

- **Optimized** specifically for the Samsung A03 Core.
- **Removed unnecessary Treble overlays** that don‚Äôt provide benefits for the Samsung A03 Core.
- Added **full** Google Apps (almost all):
    ```
    ‚Ä¢ Play Store
    ‚Ä¢ Google App (Velvet)
    ‚Ä¢ Chrome
    ‚Ä¢ Gallery
    ‚Ä¢ And all necessary services and etc.
    ```
- Hidden Treble settings for a cleaner **full-ROM feel**.  
  To access them, use the following command in a superuser terminal (these will hide again after reboot):
    ```
    su -c "pm enable me.phh.treble.app/.TopLevelSettingsActivity"
    ```
- Offline charging now redirects to system reboot.
- **Lawnchair 14** launcher fork, for a cleaner, modern UI.  
  - [Official GitHub](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair)  
  - [Fork Source](https://github.com/Goooler/LawnchairRelease)
- Replaced arm64 apps with arm32. *(Note: The app change list is missing, as the GSI was released two years ago)*
- **I love xdroid!**

## **‚õî ‚Ä¢ Bugs**

- **No VoLTE support.**
- No offline charging (now a feature due to redirection to system reboot instead of being stuck at the Samsung logo).
- **Please replace the wallpaper** to **avoid lag**.
